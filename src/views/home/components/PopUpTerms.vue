          <p class="underline mb-2">Arbitration Procedures</p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to
            file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral
            third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and
            court review of an arbitration decision or award is limited. &nbsp;The arbitrator must follow this agreement
            and can award similar damages and relief as a court.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Arbitration Selection and Authority</strong>
            : If a Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or KSG
            Mobile may initiate arbitration proceedings using either the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
            www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, which will arbitrate all Disputes. &nbsp;The arbitration shall be
            conducted before a single arbitrator and be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be
            commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of
            this Dispute Resolution and Arbitration Provision. For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than
            $50,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving
            $50,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. &nbsp;In either instance, the AAA’s
            Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. &nbsp;For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS
            Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols
            For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. This Dispute Resolution Section governs in the event it conflicts
            with the applicable arbitration rules. &nbsp;Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules
            apply to the arbitration. Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal
            Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. &nbsp;However, the arbitrator will apply
            applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition
            precedent to suit.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Arbitration Award</strong>
            : The arbitrator may award, on an individual basis, any relief that would be available pursuant to
            applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person
            who is not a party to the proceeding. &nbsp;The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not
            provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. &nbsp;Such award will be final and binding on
            the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having
            jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">

            appear in such proceeding telephonically or over a video medium such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams if offered.

          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Allocation of Arbitration Fees and Costs</strong>
            : If you assert a Dispute as an individual, you will only be required to pay arbitration fees of $250 in
            connection with any arbitration under this Dispute Resolution Section, and KSG Mobile will pay all other
            costs shared by AAA, JAMS or the arbitrator up to $5000. &nbsp;You are responsible for all additional fees
            and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.
            &nbsp;Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-2">
            <strong>Arbitration Confidentiality</strong>
            : You and KSG Mobile agree to maintain the confidential nature of any arbitration proceeding, including the
            existence of the arbitration, any confidential information learned about the other party, and the
            arbitration award, except as may be necessary in connection to a judicial challenge to the arbitration award
            or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by law or judicial decision.

            relinquishment of KSG Mobile’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other
            instance. &nbsp;The express waiver by KSG Mobile of any provision, condition, or requirement of KSG Mobile’s
            Terms shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or
            requirement. &nbsp;Except as expressly and specifically set forth in this these Terms, no representations,
            statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by KSG Mobile shall be deemed a modification of

            of a unique and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm KSG Mobile and which cannot

            other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the
            event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. &nbsp;You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive
